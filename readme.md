Automated testing framework built using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for the AIUpskilling platform.  
This project supports dynamic test execution, tagging, custom scripts, and reporting with Allure.

### Run a test with a custom script

```bash

```

 **Example:**

```bash
npm run test:farmersenroll:dynamic --count=13
```

###  Run tagged tests (e.g., smoke)

## Best Practices

- Tag your test cases appropriately using `@smoke`, `@regression`, etc.
- Keep test data modular for dynamic execution.
- Use environment configs and CLI args for better reusability.
